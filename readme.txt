Imagine you could travel back a week ago 
and make sure you spend time doing something.


The term "Pale Blue Dot" refers to a famous photograph of Earth taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1990 from a distance of about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles). To calculate how long it takes light to travel this distance:

The speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second).
Distance from Voyager 1 to Earth at the time of the "Pale Blue Dot" image: ~6 billion kilometers.
Time = Distance / Speed of light

= 6,000,000,000 km / 299,792 km/s

≈ 20,014 seconds.

Converting to hours:

20,014 seconds ÷ 3,600 seconds/hour ≈ 5.56 hours.

So, it takes light approximately 5.56 hours to travel from the "Pale Blue Dot" distance to Earth.
